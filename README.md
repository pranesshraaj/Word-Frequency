# Word-Frequency

In this notebook, we'll first scrape the novel , 'The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes' from the website using the Python package requests.

Second, we'll use 'Beautiful Soup', a Python library to extract data from HTML files and Html5lib for parsing the data.

Third, we'll use NLTK Tokenizer package to divide the string into into smaller parts called tokens.

Finally we'll remove all the Stopwords(words which does not add much meaning to a sentence) and then plot a frequency distribution graph
